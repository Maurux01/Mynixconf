# Mynixconf - Riced NixOS Configuration by Gemini

This repository contains a complete "riced" NixOS configuration generated by Gemini, featuring Hyprland, i3, and a consistent Catppuccin theme.

The configuration is located in the `gemini-riced-config` directory.

## Features

-   **System:** NixOS with Flakes
-   **GUI:** Hyprland (main) + i3 (fallback)
-   **Theme:** Catppuccin Mocha
-   **Shell:** Fish + Starship
-   **Terminal:** Kitty
-   **Editor:** Neovim (basic setup)
-   ...and many more tools and utilities.

## ðŸš€ Installation

This repository includes an automated installation script that simplifies the setup.

### Prerequisites

-   A running NixOS system.
-   An internet connection.
-   Git installed (`nix-shell -p git`).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Maurux01/Mynixconf.git
    cd Mynixconf
    ```
    *(Replace the URL with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **Run the installer:**
    Execute the `install.sh` script with `sudo`. It will automatically:
    - Back up your existing `/etc/nixos` configuration.
    - Copy the new configuration files.
    - Build and activate the new system configuration.

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```
## Post-Installation

After the installation successfully completes:

1.  **Set your password:**
    The script will prompt you, but if you need to do it manually, open a terminal and set a password for your user:
    ```bash
    passwd maurux01
    ```

2.  **Reboot:**
    Reboot your system to log in to your new desktop environment.
    ```bash
    reboot
    ```

From the login screen (`greetd`), you should be able to choose between a Hyprland and an i3 session.
